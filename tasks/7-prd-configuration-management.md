# Product Requirements Document: Configuration Management

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the Configuration Management feature of Project MonsterInc. The purpose of this feature is to allow users to define and manage global settings for the tool via an external JSON configuration file. This centralizes configuration, making it easier to modify tool behavior without recompiling the source code and facilitating different setups for various environments or use cases.

The goal is to implement a robust mechanism for reading, validating, and applying tool-wide settings from a JSON file.

## 2. Goals

*   Centralize all global tool settings into a single JSON configuration file.
*   Enable users to easily modify tool behavior (e.g., Discord webhook, scan frequencies, httpx parameters) by editing the JSON file.
*   Support hierarchical structuring of configuration settings within the JSON file for clarity.
*   Implement validation for the configuration file to ensure its integrity and correctness.
*   Allow the tool to reload configuration changes during runtime where feasible.
*   Provide sensible default behaviors or clear error reporting when configuration is missing or invalid.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As an Operator, I want to define all common settings like Discord webhook URL, default httpx thread count, and HTML/JS monitoring frequency in a single JSON file, so I can easily manage and version control my tool's configuration.**
*   **As a Developer, I want the tool to validate the JSON configuration file on startup and log detailed errors if it's malformed or contains invalid values, so I can quickly identify and fix configuration issues.**
*   **As an Administrator, I want the tool to be able to reload its configuration from the JSON file while running (if possible), so I can apply certain setting changes without interrupting ongoing long-running tasks.**

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system **must** read its global configuration settings from a user-provided JSON file.
2.  The path to the JSON configuration file **should** be specifiable (e.g., via a command-line argument or a default location).
3.  The JSON configuration file **must** support a hierarchical structure to organize settings logically. Examples of configurable parameters include:
    *   `notifications.discord.webhook_url` (string)
    *   `monitoring.html_js.scan_frequency` (string, e.g., cron expression or predefined like "daily", "hourly")
    *   `scanner.httpx.threads` (integer)
    *   `scanner.httpx.delay` (integer, milliseconds)
    *   `scanner.httpx.user_agents` (list of strings)
    *   `scanner.httpx.excluded_extensions` (list of strings)
    *   Path to the input file for targets (for target-based scanning features).
    *   Path to the input file for HTML/JS monitoring URLs.
    *   (Other global settings as identified during development of other features).
4.  The system **must** validate the configuration file upon reading it. Validation includes:
    *   Checking for valid JSON syntax.
    *   Ensuring all mandatory configuration fields are present.
    *   Verifying that values for configuration fields are of the correct data type and format (e.g., integer, boolean, valid URL format, valid cron string).
5.  **Configuration Reload:**
    *   The system **must** load the configuration upon startup.
    *   The system **should** provide a mechanism to reload the configuration during runtime (e.g., via a SIGHUP signal on POSIX systems, or a specific command/API endpoint) for settings that can be dynamically updated. The scope of dynamically updatable settings needs to be defined.
6.  **Error Handling and Defaults:**
    *   If the configuration file is not found at the specified path, the system **must** log this error. It **should** then attempt to run with a set of secure, hardcoded default values for essential operations, or exit gracefully if critical configurations are missing and no defaults are feasible.
    *   If the configuration file is found but is syntactically incorrect JSON, the system **must** log a detailed error and **must** not proceed with user-provided configuration, falling back to defaults or exiting as above.
    *   If the configuration file is valid JSON but fails validation (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect data types), the system **must** log detailed errors specifying the validation failures. It **should** then fall back to default values for the invalid/missing fields if possible, or exit if critical configurations are invalid.
7.  The system **must** provide clear logging for configuration loading status, including the path of the file being loaded, any errors encountered, and whether defaults are being used for any settings.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   Support for configuration file formats other than JSON (e.g., YAML, TOML) in the initial version.
*   Encryption of configuration values within the JSON file (sensitive values should be managed through secure environment practices if needed, not by this module encrypting/decrypting parts of the JSON).
*   A graphical user interface for managing configuration.
*   Per-user configuration files if the tool is used in a multi-user context (global configuration is assumed).

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

*   The structure of the JSON should be well-documented, including all possible keys, their data types, and whether they are mandatory or optional.
*   Provide an example configuration file with all available options and sensible defaults.
*   Consider using a mature Go library for struct-based configuration loading and validation from JSON.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

*   Define a clear Go struct (or set of structs) that mirrors the JSON configuration structure for easy parsing and access.
*   Implement a validation layer (e.g., using struct tags and a validation library) to check the loaded configuration against predefined rules.
*   For runtime reloading, ensure thread safety if configuration values are accessed by multiple goroutines.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   The tool correctly loads and applies settings from the JSON configuration file.
*   Validation errors are clearly reported, helping users to correct their configuration files.
*   The tool behaves predictably (uses defaults or exits gracefully) when the configuration is missing or invalid.
*   Runtime configuration reload (for supported settings) works as expected without requiring a full tool restart.
*   User feedback indicates that managing configuration via the JSON file is straightforward.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What specific set of configuration parameters should be dynamically reloadable at runtime versus requiring a restart?
*   What is the definitive list of all global configuration parameters needed by all planned features?
*   In case of a missing/invalid configuration file or critical invalid entries, should the tool always exit, or should it attempt to run with a minimal set of hardcoded defaults? Which configurations are considered critical for startup?
*   How will the default values be documented and maintained?
*   Should the tool offer a command to generate a sample/default configuration file?
