## Relevant Files

- `internal/httpxrunner/runner.go` - Wrapper for the `projectdiscovery/httpx` library, handles configuration, execution, and result parsing.
- `internal/config/httpx_config.go` - (Potentially new or part of existing config) Defines configuration structures for `httpx` probing within MonsterInc.
- `internal/httpxrunner/result.go` - (Potentially new or an evolution of `probe.go`'s `ProbeResult`) Defines the structured result object for `httpx` probes.
- `go.mod` - To add `github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx` dependency.

### Notes

- The existing files `internal/httpxrunner/client.go`, `internal/httpxrunner/probe.go`, and `internal/httpxrunner/techdetector.go` will likely be significantly refactored or removed as their functionality will be largely replaced by the direct integration of the `httpx` library.
